# SquidGame - Glass Bridge
A game inspired by the 5th [Squid Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game)

## Instructions
Players must cross a two-panel wide bridge. One panel is strong glass and the other is weak.
If a player steps on the weak glass, the glass breaks and the player is eliminated.

## Tech
Nothing fancy here. Just plain old vanilla HTML/ JS/ CSS.
Likely to refactor this into React.

## Thanks
Thank you for the funky font [Darrell Flood](https://www.dafont.com/game-of-squids.font).

## Next Steps (Open for collabs)
### Visual
- Make a extended letter effect like [Squid Game Title Image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqxAJKy0ii4&t=90s). 
  - Text into SVG + animation likely to the solution to this.
- Make glass appear to crack and break - SVG background?

### Sound
- Add some music / sfx. Include volume/ mute buttons from the outset.

### Game play
- Add in multiple players that can be in different positions on the game board. More true to the TV original.
- Using the awesome (Probabilty of each player winning)[https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/pxwpv0/whats_the_mathematically_best_way_to_beat_this/].
- Implement a hands-off simulation where players move automatically (and allow users to rerun the simulation X times).
