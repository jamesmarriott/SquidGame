# SquidGame - Glass Bridge
A game inspired by the 5th [Squid Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game)

## Instructions
Players must cross a two-panel wide bridge. One panel is strong glass and the other is weak.
If a player steps on the weak glass, the glass breaks and the player is eliminated.

## Tech
Nothing fancy here. Just plain old vanilla HTML/ JS/ CSS.
